## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data or handling file uploads.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to create, manage, take, and analyze quizzes.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (teacher, student, admin).

---

## Example Usage

- Teachers create and publish quizzes, and view leaderboards and results.
- Students take quizzes, view their history, and see their rankings.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can create, update, or delete quizzes.
- Validate all quiz data and user submissions to prevent errors and cheating.
- Regularly review quiz content and results for quality and fairness.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If quiz data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect quiz integrity.
