# KCAdashboard API â€“ Chess Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `chess` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all chess-related features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable users to play, manage, analyze, and track chess games and challenges, as well as interact with chess engines and PGN files. The endpoints support both real-time gameplay and historical analysis for students, teachers, and admins.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data or file uploads.
- The frontend calls these endpoints for real-time gameplay, analysis, and record management.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (student, teacher, admin).

---

## Example Usage

- Players challenge each other and play games using `challenge.php`, `make-move.php`, and related endpoints.
- Teachers or admins analyze games and track statistics using analytics endpoints.
- Practice sessions and PGN uploads support training and study.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can make moves or modify games.
- Validate all input data to prevent cheating or errors.
- Regularly clean up old and inactive games to maintain performance.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If game data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect game integrity.
