# KCAdashboard API â€“ Notifications Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `notifications` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all notification-related features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable sending, receiving, managing, and customizing notifications for users and admins. The endpoints support workflows for real-time alerts, preference management, and notification templates.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to send, receive, and manage notifications and preferences.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (admin, user).

---

## Example Usage

- Admins send notifications to users using `send.php`.
- Users manage their notification preferences and mark notifications as read.
- Notification templates ensure consistent communication.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can send or delete notifications.
- Allow users to customize their notification preferences.
- Use templates for consistent and professional messaging.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If notifications are not delivered, check the notification service configuration and delivery logs.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect user privacy.
