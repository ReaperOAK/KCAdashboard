# KCAdashboard Frontend â€“ Batches Components Documentation

## Overview

The `batches` subfolder under `components` contains React components related to batch management in KCAdashboard. These components are used to display, create, and search for student batches, supporting both administrative and teacher workflows for organizing students into groups.

  StudentSearch.js     # Component for searching students within batches
```

## How These Components Work
