# KCAdashboard API â€“ Grading Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `grading` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all grading and feedback features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable teachers and admins to manage student grading, feedback, and report cards, supporting both individual and batch-level assessment workflows.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data or handling file uploads.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage grading, feedback, and report cards.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (teacher, admin).

---

## Example Usage

- Teachers retrieve students for grading and submit feedback using these endpoints.
- Admins upload and manage report cards for official records.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can access and modify grading data.
- Validate input data to maintain grading integrity and prevent errors.
- Regularly review feedback and report card records for completeness and accuracy.

---


## Troubleshooting

- If grading data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect sensitive data.
- If you encounter a 500 error from `get-pending.php`, check the PHP error logs for details. The endpoint now logs errors and returns a JSON error message for diagnostics.

---

## Recent Improvements
- Error handling and logging added to `get-pending.php` for better diagnostics and reliability.
