# KCAdashboard API â€“ Resources Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `resources` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all resource management features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable uploading, sharing, searching, bookmarking, and downloading educational resources for students, teachers, and admins. The endpoints support workflows for resource discovery, access control, and sharing across batches and classrooms.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data or handling file uploads/downloads.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage, search, and share resources.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (student, teacher, admin).

---

## Example Usage

- Teachers upload and share resources with their classes or batches.
- Students bookmark and download resources for study.
- Admins review resource access logs for analytics.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can upload, share, or download resources.
- Validate all uploaded files for security and compliance.
- Regularly review resource metadata and access logs for quality and usage.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If resources are missing or inaccessible, check the underlying database queries and file storage.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect resource integrity.
