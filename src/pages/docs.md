# KCAdashboard Frontend â€“ Pages Documentation

## Overview

The `pages` folder contains all top-level page components for the KCAdashboard frontend. Each file or subfolder represents a distinct route or section of the application, such as authentication, user profile, admin dashboard, chess features, notifications, and role-specific dashboards for students and teachers. Pages are responsible for orchestrating data fetching, state management, and rendering the appropriate UI components for each section.

---

## File Structure

```
pages/
  Profile.js           # User profile page
  admin/               # Admin dashboard and management pages
  auth/                # Authentication pages (login, register, reset, verify)
  chess/               # Chess-related pages (game area, PGN management, etc.)
  notifications/       # Notification preferences and management
  student/             # Student dashboard, quizzes, resources, reports, etc.
  teacher/             # Teacher dashboard, batch/classroom management, grading, etc.
```

---

## File Explanations

- **Profile.js**  
  The user profile page. Allows users to view and update their personal information (name, email) using a form powered by Formik and Yup for validation. Integrates with the authentication context to update user data.

- **admin/**  
  Contains all admin-facing pages, including dashboards, analytics, user management, attendance, tournaments, and support systems.

- **auth/**  
  Handles authentication flows: login, registration, password reset, and email verification.

- **chess/**  
  Chess features such as playing games, viewing PGN files, and interactive boards.

- **notifications/**  
  Pages for managing notification preferences and viewing notifications.

- **student/**  
  Student dashboard, classroom pages, quizzes, resources, leaderboard, report cards, and tournament participation.

- **teacher/**  
  Teacher dashboard, batch and classroom management, quiz creation, grading, and analytics.

- **AttendanceSettings.js (admin/)**  
  The admin attendance settings page. Orchestrates state, loading, error, and success feedback for attendance settings. Uses modular components (`SettingsForm`, `ErrorAlert`, `AttendanceSettingsSkeleton`) for a beautiful, accessible, and responsive UI. All color classes use design tokens from `colour_scheme.md` and `tailwind.config.js`. Follows single-responsibility and performance best practices.
  - **2025-07**: AttendanceSystem, StudentAttendanceHistory, and related components now feature a fully modular, beautiful, and responsive UI. Controls and headings stack or wrap at all breakpoints, including half-screen and 8:9 aspect ratios. StudentAttendanceHistory now handles loading, error, and empty states with clear feedback and retry. All UI uses the design system and is optimized for performance and accessibility.

---

## Features

- **Route-Based Organization:** Each file or subfolder maps to a route in the application.
- **Role-Specific Pages:** Separate folders for admin, student, and teacher experiences.
- **Form Handling:** Uses Formik and Yup for robust form validation and state management (e.g., Profile.js).
- **Modular Structure:** Pages import and compose reusable components and hooks.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Pages handle orchestration, while components handle UI and logic.

---

## How Pages Work

- Each page is typically mapped to a route using React Router.
- Pages fetch data, manage state, and render the appropriate UI for their section.
- Subfolders group related pages for each user role or feature area.

---

## Example Usage

**Profile Page:**
```
import Profile from './pages/Profile';
<Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
```

**Admin Dashboard:**
```
import AdminDashboard from './pages/admin/AdminDashboard';
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep page components focused on orchestration; delegate UI and logic to child components and hooks.
- Use subfolders to organize pages by user role or feature area for maintainability.
- Validate all user input in forms and handle errors gracefully.
- Use React Router for clean, maintainable routing.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Page not rendering:** Check route configuration and file/component exports.
- **Form errors:** Ensure Formik and Yup schemas are correctly set up and error messages are displayed.
- **Data not loading:** Verify data fetching logic and API endpoints.
