# KCAdashboard API â€“ Models Documentation

## Overview

The `models` folder contains PHP classes that represent the core data entities in KCAdashboard. These model files encapsulate the structure, relationships, and business logic for analytics, users, attendance, chess games, quizzes, notifications, and more. Models are used throughout the API to interact with the database and enforce data integrity.

  Manages attendance records, validation, and related business rules.

- **Batch.php**  
  Represents batch entities, including relationships to students and classrooms.

- **ChessChallenge.php**  
  Models chess challenge data and challenge logic.

- **ChessGame.php**

## How Models Work

- Each PHP file defines a class that maps to a database table or entity.
- Models are used by endpoints and services to query, update, and validate data.
- Business logic and data relationships are encapsulated within model classes.

---

## Example Usage

- Endpoints include model files to interact with the database (e.g., fetching users, saving attendance).
- Models enforce validation and business rules before data is saved or updated.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep model logic focused on data structure, relationships, and validation.
- Avoid placing unrelated business logic in models; use services for complex workflows.
- Regularly review and update models as the database schema evolves.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If data is missing or incorrect, check the model logic and database queries.
- Ensure models are properly included and instantiated in endpoint files.
