## New Feature: Teacher Quiz Leaderboard

- When adding new quiz-related features, ensure both students and teachers have access to relevant analytics and leaderboards.
- Teacher leaderboard pages should use the same API endpoints as student leaderboard pages for consistency.
- When adding a new teacher page, update `src/pages/teacher/docs.md` and the main `README.md`.
- Add new routes to `src/routes/teacherRoutes.js` and test navigation from the Quiz Management page.

See the codebase and documentation for more details.
