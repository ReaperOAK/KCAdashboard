# Kolkata Chess Academy Dashboard


## ÔøΩ July 2025: Settings Page, Session Management & Backend Robustness

- **Settings Page**: Added a dedicated Settings page accessible from the sidebar and user dropdown. Users can now manage their account security and active sessions from one place.
- **Session Management**: Users can view all active login sessions, log out from other devices, and monitor session activity for enhanced security. Session limits and durations are role-based and configurable by admins.
- **Backend Robustness**: Improved PHP backend to use absolute paths for session config, added error handling and output buffering to prevent PHP warnings from breaking JSON responses, and enhanced frontend parsing of API responses with PHP warnings. This ensures reliable session management and authentication even if server warnings occur.

See [`docs/session-management.md`](docs/session-management.md) for full details.

Welcome! KCAdashboard is a modern, beautiful, and accessible dashboard for the Kolkata Chess Academy.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

```powershell
cd c:\Owais\KCAdashboard; npm install; npm start
```


## üìù July 2025 Update: Quiz Chess Move Feedback
Chess quiz questions now provide instant feedback for both correct and incorrect moves. Wrong moves are highlighted and users are prompted to try again, improving the learning experience for both FEN and PGN quiz modes.

## üÜï July 2025: Show/Hide Password Option
All authentication forms (Login, Register, Reset Password) now include a "Show Password" toggle for better usability. A reusable `PasswordInput` component is available for use in any form. See `src/components/common/PasswordInput.js` and `FormikPasswordField.js` for details.

## üü¢ July 2025 Update: Teacher Attendance Batch Selection
Teachers no longer need to manually select a batch before marking attendance. The system now automatically determines the batch from the student being marked, streamlining the attendance process and preventing errors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è July 2025 Update: PGN Upload 50-Game Limit
To prevent performance issues and application hanging, PGN uploads are now limited to a maximum of 50 games per file. This ensures smooth user experience when uploading and viewing PGN files. Existing large PGN files (like the 3K games file) are automatically truncated to the first 50 games when viewed.

## üü¢ July 2025 Update: Grading Workflow & Pending Grading Modal Fix


## üÜï July 2025: Student Dashboard Quick Links
The Student Dashboard now features prominent navigation cards for "Feedback & Grading" and "Report Cards". These cards provide students with one-click access to their feedback history and academic performance reports, improving discoverability and navigation. The cards are fully accessible, responsive, and follow the KCA design system.



## üü¢ July 2025: Teacher Dashboard React Key Bugfix & List Rendering Robustness

- Fixed: All React lists in the Teacher Dashboard now use robust, unique keys to prevent duplicate/empty key warnings and ensure stable UI updates.
- Improved: All mapped lists (modals, stats, activities) now have fallback keys for edge cases, eliminating React key warnings and improving dashboard reliability.

This project uses a custom color system defined in `colour_scheme.md` and `tailwind.config.js`. All UI components are built with Tailwind utility classes and follow the design system for consistency, accessibility, and visual clarity.

### Color Tokens

See `colour_scheme.md` for the full palette and usage guide.
