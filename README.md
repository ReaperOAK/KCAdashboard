## Registration & Role Security Policy (July 2025)

All new user registrations are created as **students**. Only administrators can promote users to teacher or admin roles via the user management interface. This prevents unauthorized access to teacher dashboards and ensures secure role management. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` and API docs for details.

For all project details, see the docs above.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Design System

This project uses a custom color system defined in `colour_scheme.md` and `tailwind.config.js`. All UI components are built with Tailwind utility classes and follow the design system for consistency, accessibility, and visual clarity.

### Color Tokens

See `colour_scheme.md` for the full palette and usage guide.

### UI/UX Principles

- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Accessible components (ARIA, keyboard navigation, visually hidden text)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
- Visual hierarchy and clarity
- Loading, error, and empty states handled in all major components
- Iconography for actions and statuses

## Contributing

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for guidelines.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è PGN to Quiz Integration (July 2025)

- See `src/hooks/usePGNQuizIntegration.js` and `src/components/chess/pgnlibrary/` for implementation details.

- See `README-quiz-no-retake-policy.md` for full details.
