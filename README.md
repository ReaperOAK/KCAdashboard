## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

```powershell
cd c:\Owais\KCAdashboard; npm install; npm start

## üìù July 2025 Update: Quiz Chess Move Feedback
Chess quiz questions now provide instant feedback for both correct and incorrect moves. Wrong moves are highlighted and users are prompted to try again, improving the learning experience for both FEN and PGN quiz modes.

## üÜï July 2025: Show/Hide Password Option
All authentication forms (Login, Register, Reset Password) now include a "Show Password" toggle for better usability. A reusable `PasswordInput` component is available for use in any form. See `src/components/common/PasswordInput.js` and `FormikPasswordField.js` for details.

## üü¢ July 2025 Update: Teacher Attendance Batch Selection
Teachers no longer need to manually select a batch before marking attendance. The system now automatically determines the batch from the student being marked, streamlining the attendance process and preventing errors.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è July 2025 Update: PGN Upload 50-Game Limit
To prevent performance issues and application hanging, PGN uploads are now limited to a maximum of 50 games per file. This ensures smooth user experience when uploading and viewing PGN files. Existing large PGN files (like the 3K games file) are automatically truncated to the first 50 games when viewed.

## üü¢ July 2025 Update: Grading Workflow & Pending Grading Modal Fix

- Fixed: Pending grading modal now disappears after feedback is submitted for a session.
- Feedback submission now links feedback to the specific session, ensuring accurate tracking.
- Backend and frontend updated to support session-specific grading and feedback.

## Registration & Role Security Policy (July 2025)

All new user registrations are created as **students**. Only administrators can promote users to teacher or admin roles via the user management interface. This prevents unauthorized access to teacher dashboards and ensures secure role management. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` and API docs for details.

For all project details, see the docs above.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## User Menu & Profile/Logout Dropdown (July 2025)

The top navigation bar features a user menu with a dropdown containing "Profile" and "Logout" actions. The dropdown is fully accessible (keyboard, ARIA, focus management), and only appears when clicking the user avatar. All actions are handled inside the dropdown for clarity and accessibility.

## Design System

This project uses a custom color system defined in `colour_scheme.md` and `tailwind.config.js`. All UI components are built with Tailwind utility classes and follow the design system for consistency, accessibility, and visual clarity.

### Color Tokens

See `colour_scheme.md` for the full palette and usage guide.

### UI/UX Principles

- Responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Accessible components (ARIA, keyboard navigation, visually hidden text)
- Consistent spacing, typography, and color usage
- Visual hierarchy and clarity
- Loading, error, and empty states handled in all major components
- Iconography for actions and statuses
