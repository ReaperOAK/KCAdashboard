## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data for use in dashboards and reports.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to display analytics and visualizations for students, teachers, and admins.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles to ensure privacy and data security.

---

## Example Usage

- The frontend dashboard makes a GET request to `/api/endpoints/analytics/attendance.php` to fetch attendance analytics for display.
- Batch comparison, quiz results, and performance analytics are fetched similarly for reporting and insights.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure analytics endpoints are optimized for performance, especially when processing large datasets.
- Restrict access to sensitive analytics data based on user roles.
- Regularly review and update analytics logic to reflect evolving reporting needs.
- Provide clear and well-structured JSON responses for easy frontend integration.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If analytics data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect sensitive data.
