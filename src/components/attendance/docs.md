## Attendance Components (July 2025 UI/UX Overhaul & Responsive Improvements)

All attendance components follow the Kolkata Chess Academy design system (see `colour_scheme.md`), are fully accessible, responsive, and optimized for performance.
Recent updates (July 2025):
  - **Teacher Attendance Batch Selection**: Teachers no longer need to select a batch before marking attendance. The batch is now determined automatically from the student, making the process faster and error-free.
- **StudentAttendanceList**: Now split into container (`StudentAttendanceList.js`) and presentational (`StudentAttendanceListView.js`) components for single-responsibility and maintainability. All UI uses color tokens and is fully responsive and accessible.
- **StudentAttendanceTable**: Beautiful, responsive table for student attendance summary. Alternating row backgrounds, status icons, color tokens, and accessibility improvements.
- **StudentAttendanceSkeleton**: Modern shimmer skeleton for attendance data loading.
- **SearchAndBatchFilter**: Search input and batch select, fully accessible and responsive.
- **BatchSelect**: Improved accessibility, label, and dropdown visibility. Now fully responsive and beautiful on all screen sizes.
- **AttendanceSystem**: Heading, batch select, and export controls now stack or wrap naturally at all breakpoints (desktop, mobile, tablet, 8:9, half-screen, etc.).
- **Layout**: Controls use flex-wrap and adaptive spacing for perfect fit at all aspect ratios.
- **UI/UX**: All controls, tables, and modals use color tokens, focus/hover/active states, and are keyboard/ARIA accessible.
- **Performance**: All components are memoized and single-responsibility.
