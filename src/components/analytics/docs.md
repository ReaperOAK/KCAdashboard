# Analytics Components â€“ KCAdashboard

## July 2025 Refactor

All analytics dashboard UI and components have been refactored for a beautiful, modern, and accessible user experience:
- Modular, single-responsibility React components
- Fully responsive layouts for all screen sizes
- Consistent use of Tailwind color tokens and the design system (see `colour_scheme.md`)
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, focus/hover/active states
- Performance: React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, and lazy loading for all heavy/chart components
- All files are imported and registered in `PlatformAnalytics.js` and used in the analytics dashboard

## Components
