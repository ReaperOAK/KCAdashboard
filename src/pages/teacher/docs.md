## How These Pages Work

- Each page is mapped to a teacher route and orchestrates data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.
- Pages import and compose reusable components and hooks for modularity.
- Teacher navigation links to these pages for a smooth workflow.

---

## Example Usage

**Teacher Dashboard Route:**
```
import TeacherDashboard from './pages/teacher/TeacherDashboard';
<Route path="/teacher" element={<TeacherDashboard />} />
```

**Quiz Creator Route:**
```
import QuizCreator from './pages/teacher/QuizCreator';
<Route path="/teacher/quiz/create" element={<QuizCreator />} />
```

## Best Practices

- Keep page components focused on orchestration; delegate UI and logic to child components and hooks.
- Validate all user input and handle errors gracefully.
- Use modular, reusable components for consistency and maintainability.
- Provide clear feedback and progress indicators for teachers.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Page not loading:** Check route configuration and authentication/authorization logic.
- **Data not updating:** Verify API endpoints and state management in the page/component.
- **UI inconsistencies:** Ensure all teacher pages use shared components and styles.
