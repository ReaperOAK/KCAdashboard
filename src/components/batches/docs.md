## How These Components Work

- Components are imported and used in batch management pages or other components.
- They interact with the backend via API calls to fetch, create, or search batch data.
- Designed to be reusable and composable for batch-related workflows.

---

## Example Usage

- Admins or teachers use `BatchList.js` to view and select batches.
- `CreateBatchForm.js` is used in batch creation pages or modals.
- `StudentSearch.js` is used to find and assign students to batches.

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused, reusable, and single-responsibility.
- Use Tailwind color tokens and design system for all UI elements.
- Use React.memo, useCallback, and useMemo for performance.
- Ensure all fields and actions are accessible (ARIA, keyboard, focus, etc.).
- Document component props and usage for maintainability.
