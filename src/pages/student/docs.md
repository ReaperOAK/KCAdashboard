## Features

- **Progress Tracking:** Leaderboards, report cards, and quiz history for self-assessment.
- **Interactive Learning:** Access to resources, feedback, and classroom activities.
- **Seamless Navigation:** Pages are organized for easy access to all student features.

## How These Pages Work

- Each page is mapped to a student route and orchestrates data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.
- Pages import and compose reusable components and hooks for modularity.
- Student navigation links to these pages for a smooth workflow.

---

## Example Usage

**Student Dashboard Route:**
```
import StudentDashboard from './pages/student/StudentDashboard';
<Route path="/student" element={<StudentDashboard />} />
```

**Quiz Page Route:**
```
import QuizPage from './pages/student/QuizPage';
<Route path="/student/quiz/:quizId" element={<QuizPage />} />
```

## Best Practices

- Keep page components focused on orchestration; delegate UI and logic to child components and hooks.
- Validate all user input and handle errors gracefully.
- Use modular, reusable components for consistency and maintainability.
- Provide clear feedback and progress indicators for students.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Page not loading:** Check route configuration and authentication/authorization logic.
- **Data not updating:** Verify API endpoints and state management in the page/component.
- **UI inconsistencies:** Ensure all student pages use shared components and styles.
