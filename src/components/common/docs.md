# KCAdashboard Frontend â€“ Common Components Documentation

## Overview

The `common` subfolder under `components` contains general-purpose React components that are reused throughout the KCAdashboard frontend. These components are not tied to a specific feature or module, making them ideal for use in multiple places across the application.

---

## File Structure

```
components/common/
  Modal.js   # Reusable modal dialog component
```

---

## File Explanations

- **Modal.js**  
  A reusable modal dialog component for displaying popups, forms, alerts, and confirmations. It can be customized with different content and actions, and is used throughout the app wherever a modal dialog is needed.

---

## How This Component Works

- The `Modal.js` component is imported and used in pages and other components to display modal dialogs.
- It accepts props for controlling visibility, content, and actions.
- Designed to be flexible and composable for a variety of use cases.

---

## Example Usage

- Used for confirmation dialogs, forms, alerts, and custom popups in different parts of the app.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep the modal component generic and customizable.
- Document component props and usage for maintainability.
