# KCAdashboard API â€“ Notifications Endpoints Documentation

## July 2025 Notification System Refactor

- All notification endpoints now use the centralized NotificationService for sending, deleting, and managing notifications.
- All user IDs and input data are sanitized and validated for security.
- All endpoints set CORS and JSON headers, and log errors for easier debugging.
- Notification categories are standardized and all logic respects user preferences.
- See CONTRIBUTING.md for coding standards and notification requirements.

## Overview

The `notifications` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all notification-related features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable sending, receiving, managing, and customizing notifications for users and admins. The endpoints support workflows for real-time alerts, preference management, and notification templates.

## File Structure

```
endpoints/notifications/
  admin-sent.php         # List notifications sent by admin
  delete.php             # Delete a notification
  get-preferences.php    # Get user notification preferences
  get.php                # Retrieve notifications
  mark-all-read.php      # Mark all notifications as read
  mark-read.php          # Mark a notification as read
  send.php               # Send a notification
  templates.php          # Manage notification templates
  update-preferences.php # Update notification preferences
```

## File Explanations

- **admin-sent.php**  
  Lists all notifications sent by admin users, supporting audit and review. Uses the centralized NotificationService to retrieve and group admin-sent notifications. Do not query the notifications table directly for grouping; always use NotificationService for notification logic.

- **delete.php**  
  Deletes a specific notification for a user. Uses the centralized NotificationService for deletion logic. Do not call the model directly; always use NotificationService for notification deletion. User ownership is enforced for security.

- **get-preferences.php**  
  Retrieves the current notification preferences for a user (e.g., email, SMS, in-app). User ID is sanitized and validated.

- **get.php**  
  Retrieves all notifications for a user, supporting inbox and alert features. User ID is sanitized and validated.

- **mark-all-read.php**  
  Marks all notifications as read for a user, clearing notification badges. User ID is sanitized and validated.

- **mark-read.php**  
  Marks a specific notification as read. Both notification ID and user ID are sanitized and validated.

- **send.php**  
  Sends a new notification to one or more users.

- **templates.php**  
  Manages notification templates for consistent messaging.

- **update-preferences.php**  
  Updates a user's notification preferences. User ID and preferences data are sanitized and validated.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to send, receive, and manage notifications and preferences.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (admin, user).

---

## Example Usage

- Admins send notifications to users using `send.php`.
- Users manage their notification preferences and mark notifications as read.
- Notification templates ensure consistent communication.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use NotificationService for all notification logic (send, delete, update, list).
- Sanitize and validate all user IDs and input data in endpoints.
- Ensure only authorized users can send or delete notifications.
- Allow users to customize their notification preferences.
- Use templates for consistent and professional messaging.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If notifications are not delivered, check the notification service configuration and delivery logs.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect user privacy.
