# KCAdashboard API â€“ Middleware Documentation

## Overview

The `middleware` folder contains PHP scripts that act as middleware for the KCAdashboard API. Middleware is used to process requests before they reach the main endpoint logic, providing a layer for authentication, authorization, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns. This ensures that only authorized users can access protected API endpoints and that requests are handled securely.

---

## File Structure

```
middleware/
  auth.php   # Middleware for authentication and authorization
```

---

## File Explanations

- **auth.php**  
  Handles authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (checking user permissions) for API requests. It is included at the start of protected endpoints to ensure only users with valid credentials and appropriate roles can access certain features.

---

## How Middleware Works

- Middleware scripts are included at the top of endpoint files that require protection.
- They check for valid authentication tokens, sessions, or credentials.
- If the user is not authenticated or lacks the required permissions, the middleware blocks the request and returns an error response.

---

## Example Usage

- All sensitive or protected API endpoints include `auth.php` to enforce security.
- If a user tries to access an admin-only endpoint without proper credentials, `auth.php` will deny access.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use middleware for authentication and authorization on protected endpoints.
- Keep middleware logic modular and reusable for consistency and maintainability.
- Regularly review and update authentication and authorization logic to address new security threats.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If users are denied access unexpectedly, check the logic in `auth.php` and ensure credentials are being passed correctly.
- Review error messages and logs to diagnose authentication or permission issues.
