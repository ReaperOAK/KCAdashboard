# KCAdashboard API â€“ Classroom Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `classroom` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all classroom management features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable the creation, management, and participation in classrooms, including assignments, materials, sessions, discussions, and attendance. The endpoints support workflows for students, teachers, and administrators.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage classrooms, assignments, sessions, and discussions.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (student, teacher, admin).

---

## Example Usage

- Teachers create assignments and sessions, and manage classroom materials.
- Students enroll in classes, submit assignments, and participate in discussions.
- Admins track attendance and sync batch/classroom data for reporting.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can modify classroom data.
- Validate input data to prevent errors and maintain data integrity.
- Regularly review classroom membership, assignments, and materials for accuracy.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If classroom data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect sensitive data.
