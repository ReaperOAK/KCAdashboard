## Features

- **Comprehensive Admin Tools:** Dashboards, analytics, and management interfaces for all core platform entities.
- **Role-Based Access:** Pages are protected and only accessible to admin users.
- **Data-Driven UI:** Fetches and displays real-time data for attendance, users, tournaments, and more.
- **Bulk Actions:** Support for batch operations (e.g., attendance, user management).
- **Audit & Reporting:** Activity logs and reports for transparency and compliance.

## How These Pages Work

- Each page is mapped to an admin route and orchestrates data fetching, state management, and UI rendering.
- Pages import and compose reusable components, hooks, and modals for a modular architecture.
- Admin navigation links to these pages for seamless workflow.

---

## Example Usage

**Admin Dashboard Route:**
```
import AdminDashboard from './pages/admin/AdminDashboard';
<Route path="/admin" element={<AdminDashboard />} />
```

**User Management Route:**
```
import UserManagement from './pages/admin/UserManagement';
<Route path="/admin/users" element={<UserManagement />} />
```

---

## Best Practices

- Keep page components focused on orchestration; delegate UI and logic to child components and hooks.
- Use clear, role-based navigation and access control.
- Validate all user input and handle errors gracefully.
- Use modular, reusable components for consistency and maintainability.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Page not loading:** Check route configuration and authentication/authorization logic.
- **Data not updating:** Verify API endpoints and state management in the page/component.
- **UI inconsistencies:** Ensure all admin pages use shared components and styles.
