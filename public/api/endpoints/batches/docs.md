# KCAdashboard API â€“ Batches Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `batches` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all batch management features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable the creation, updating, deletion, and management of student batches, as well as the assignment and removal of students from batches. The endpoints support both administrative and teacher workflows for organizing students into groups.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage batches, assign students, and update batch details.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (admin, teacher).

---

## Example Usage

- Admins or teachers create new batches using `create.php`.
- Students are assigned or removed from batches using `add-student.php` and `remove-student.php`.
- Batch details and student lists are fetched for display and management.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can modify batch data.
- Validate input data to prevent errors and maintain data integrity.
- Regularly review batch membership and details for accuracy.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If batch data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect sensitive data.
