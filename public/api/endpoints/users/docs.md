# KCAdashboard API â€“ Users Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `users` endpoints folder provides the backend API for all user management features in KCAdashboard. These PHP files enable the creation, updating, deletion, and management of user accounts, roles, permissions, and activity logs. The endpoints support workflows for admins, teachers, and user management automation.

## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage users, roles, and permissions.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (admin, teacher).

---

## Example Usage

- Admins manage user accounts, roles, and permissions using these endpoints.
- Teachers and admins search for students and manage user details.
- Activity logs are used for auditing and monitoring user actions.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can modify user data or permissions.
- Validate all input data to maintain data integrity and security.
- Regularly review user roles, permissions, and activity logs for compliance.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If user data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect user data.
