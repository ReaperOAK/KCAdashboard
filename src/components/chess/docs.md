## How These Components Work

- Components are imported and used in chess-related pages and features.
- They interact with the backend via API calls for game state, analysis, and player data.
- Designed to be reusable and composable for chess workflows.

---

## Example Usage

- Users play games using `ChessBoard.js` and review games with `PGNViewer.js`.
- Teachers assign quizzes using `ChessQuizBoard.js` and analyze games with `EngineAnalysis.js`.
- Players upload and manage PGN files with `PGNUpload.js` and `PGNLibrary.js`.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep components focused and reusable.
- Document component props and usage for maintainability.
- Use modular design for chess features to support future expansion.

## PGN 50-Game Limit (July 2025)

### Performance Safety Measures
To prevent application hanging and ensure smooth user experience, PGN files are limited to 50 games:

- **Upload Limit**: New PGN uploads are restricted to maximum 50 games per file
- **Frontend Validation**: PGN parser checks game count before processing
- **Backend Validation**: Server-side validation prevents large PGN uploads
- **Viewer Safety**: PGN viewer automatically limits display to first 50 games
- **Existing Files**: Large PGN files already in the database are truncated to 50 games when viewed

### Components Affected
- `PGNUpload.js`: Validates game count in both manual and automatic parsers
- `PGNViewer.js`: Limits display to 50 games with warning message
- `PGNFileDrop.js`: Shows warning about 50-game limit
- Backend endpoints: `upload-pgn.php`, `validate-pgn.php`, `get-game.php`

### QuickActions.js
Quick start actions for PGN management. Uses design tokens and is fully responsive.

### UploadHelpSection.js
