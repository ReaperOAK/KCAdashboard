- Backend validation: Server-side validation in upload-pgn.php and validate-pgn.php enforces limit
- PGN viewer safety: Automatically limits display to first 50 games with warning message for large files
- Existing large PGN files are truncated to 50 games when viewed to prevent hanging
- Updated UI to show warning about 50-game limit in upload components

- All moves (correct and incorrect) are now reported to the quiz system for accurate scoring and analytics.

## Security: Registration & Role Management Update (2025-07-23)
- All new user registrations are now always created as students. Teacher/admin roles can only be assigned by an admin via the user management interface.
