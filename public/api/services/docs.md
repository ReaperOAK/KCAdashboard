# KCAdashboard API â€“ Services Documentation

## Overview

The `services` folder contains PHP classes that encapsulate business logic for sending emails and notifications in KCAdashboard. Service classes are used by endpoints and other backend components to perform complex operations that go beyond simple data access, such as composing and sending emails or managing notification delivery.

---

## File Structure

```
services/
  EmailService.php         # Handles sending emails and email-related logic
  NotificationService.php  # Manages sending notifications to users
```

---

## File Explanations

- **EmailService.php**  
  Provides methods for composing, sending, and logging emails. Used for user registration, password resets, notifications, and other email-based features.

- **NotificationService.php**  
  Manages the creation and delivery of notifications to users, supporting in-app, email, or other notification channels.

---

## How Services Work

- Service classes are instantiated and used by endpoint files or other backend components.
- They encapsulate reusable business logic, making the codebase more modular and maintainable.
- Services may interact with models, configuration files, and external APIs (e.g., SMTP servers).

---

## Example Usage

- When a user registers, `EmailService.php` is used to send a verification email.
- When an event occurs (e.g., new assignment, notification), `NotificationService.php` is used to alert users.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep service logic focused and reusable; avoid duplicating code across endpoints.
- Handle errors and logging within services for better traceability.
- Regularly review and update service logic as business requirements evolve.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If emails or notifications are not delivered, check the service logic and external service configurations (SMTP, etc.).
- Ensure services are properly included and instantiated in endpoint files.
