# KCAdashboard API â€“ Support Tickets Endpoints Documentation

## Overview

The `tickets` endpoints folder under `support` provides the backend API for managing support tickets in KCAdashboard. This PHP file enables admins and support staff to retrieve all submitted support tickets, helping them track, respond to, and resolve user issues efficiently.

---

## File Structure

```
endpoints/support/tickets/
  get-all.php   # Retrieve all support tickets
```

---

## File Explanations

- **get-all.php**  
  Retrieves all support tickets submitted by users, supporting the display and management of support requests in the admin or support dashboard.

---

## How These Endpoints Work

- The PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls this endpoint to display all support tickets to admins or support staff.
- Access may be restricted to authorized support personnel or admins.

---

## Example Usage

- Support staff view all submitted tickets to track and resolve user issues.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can access support ticket data.
- Keep ticket data organized and up to date for efficient support.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tickets are missing or not updating, check the underlying database queries and data sources in the PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place for managing tickets.
