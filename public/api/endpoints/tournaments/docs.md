## How These Endpoints Work

- Each PHP file acts as a RESTful API endpoint, typically returning JSON data.
- The frontend calls these endpoints to manage tournaments, handle registrations, and process payments.
- Access may be restricted based on user roles (admin, organizer, participant).

---

## Example Usage

- Organizers create and update tournaments, and manage registrations.
- Participants register for tournaments and check their registration/payment status.
- Admins review all tournaments and manage tournament data.

---

## Best Practices

- Ensure only authorized users can create, update, or delete tournaments.
- Validate all registration and payment data to prevent errors and fraud.
- Regularly review tournament data for accuracy and compliance.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If tournament data is missing or incorrect, check the underlying database queries and data sources in each PHP file.
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization checks are in place to protect tournament integrity.
