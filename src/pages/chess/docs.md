## Features

- **Multiple Game Modes:** Supports single-player, player-vs-player, and AI chess games.
- **PGN Management:** Upload, view, and analyze chess games using PGN files.

## How These Pages Work

- Each page is mapped to a chess-related route (e.g., `/chess`, `/chess/play`, `/chess/pgn`).
- Pages fetch and manage game data, user moves, and PGN files as needed.
- Components are composed for modularity and reusability across chess features.

---

## Example Usage

**Chess Home Route:**
```
import ChessHome from './pages/chess/ChessHome';
<Route path="/chess" element={<ChessHome />} />
```

**PGN Management Route:**
```
import PGNManagementPage from './pages/chess/PGNManagementPage';
<Route path="/chess/pgn" element={<PGNManagementPage />} />
```

## Best Practices

- Keep game logic and state management in dedicated components or hooks.
- Validate all user moves and PGN uploads for integrity.
- Use modular components for chessboard, timers, and controls.
- Provide clear feedback and error messages for invalid actions.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Game not starting:** Check game state initialization and route configuration.
- **PGN not loading:** Ensure file format is correct and API endpoints are reachable.
- **Board not interactive:** Verify event handlers and component props.
